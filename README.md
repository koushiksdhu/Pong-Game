# Pong Game

This project is a Pong game built using Python and the Turtle library. It is a classic arcade game where players control paddles to hit a ball and prevent it from reaching their side of the screen. The game provides a simple and interactive experience for players to enjoy.

## Features

1. Game Interface: The application provides a graphical interface where players can see the paddles, ball, and score. The screen is divided into two halves, representing the players' sides.

2. Player Controls: Each player controls a paddle using the keyboard arrow keys. The left player uses the "W" and "S" keys to move up and down, while the right player uses the up and down arrow keys.

3. Ball Movement: The ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the paddles and walls. The speed and direction of the ball change based on the angle at which it hits the paddles.

4. Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the score for each player. A player scores a point when the opponent fails to hit the ball. The score is displayed on the screen, and the game ends when one player reaches the winning score.

## Prerequisites

To run the Pong Game, ensure you have the following:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher) installed on your computer.

## Usage

1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the Pong Game:
   ```
   $ python main.py
   ```

4. The game window will open, displaying the paddles, ball, and score.

5. Player 1 (left) controls their paddle using the "W" and "S" keys. Player 2 (right) controls their paddle using the up and down arrow keys.

6. The game begins automatically when the program starts. The ball moves across the screen, and players use their paddles to hit the ball.

7. Each time a player fails to hit the ball, the opponent scores a point. The score is displayed on the screen.

8. The game continues until one player reaches the winning score. The winning player's score will be highlighted, and the game will end.

9. To exit the game, close the game window or press the "Esc" key.

## Customization

You can customize the Pong Game by modifying the code in the `main.py` file. You can change the game settings, adjust the paddle and ball attributes, or add additional features to enhance the gameplay.
